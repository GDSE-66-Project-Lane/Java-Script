    //how to create a variable in JS
    //Strong Type
    //String name="Malitha";
    //int age=100;
    //int age="100"; //error

    //if a data type is defined before or after a variable and
    //if the value can be assigned according the data type those
    //languages are known as strong type languages


    //So this is how to create a variable in JS
    var name='Kavindu'; // what is the data type here.?
    //variable (Declaration Type)
    //because there is no type defined while creating a variable
    //js is known as Loose Type language



    //Dynamic Typing
    var address="Galle";
    typeof address;//string

    address=100;//we can change it as we like
    typeof address;//number -it will change dynamically to a number type

    address=true;//we can change it as we like
    typeof address;//boolean -it will change dynamically to a boolean type
    //because of this reason js is known as a dynamic type language



    //Scope Issue with var
    var age=100; //global variable
    {
        console.log(age);// working
    }



    {
        //local scope
        var tp=1199;
    }
    console.log(tp);//normally should be an error
    //but in js no issue at all. you can access var variables outside the scope
    //var is not satisfying scopes


    //variable hoisting
    console.log(i);//we can use variables which can be later initialized,
    //This is not an error according to js
    //according to the js, it's feature called hoisting

    var i=100;//initialize

    //what are the qualities with var variables?
    //01. Loose Typing
    //02. Dynamic Typing
    //03. Not care about scope
    //04. Variable hoisting

    //Var issues
    //01.Can duplicate same variable name
    //02.Not care about scope


    //let declaration type
    let myID="C001";
