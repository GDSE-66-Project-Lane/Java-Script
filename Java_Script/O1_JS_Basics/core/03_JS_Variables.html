    //how to create a variable in JS
    //Strong Type
    //String name="Malitha";
    //int age=100;
    //int age="100"; //error

    //if a data type is defined before or after a variable and
    //if the value can be assigned according the data type those
    //languages are known as strong type languages


    //So this is how to create a variable in JS
    var name='Kavindu'; // what is the data type here.?
    //variable (Declaration Type)
    //because there is no type defined while creating a variable
    //js is known as Loose Type language

    //Dynamic Typing
    var address="Galle";
    typeof address;//string

    address=100;//we can chanage it as we like
    typeof address;//number -it will change dynamically to a number type

    //because of this reason js is known as a dynamic type language
